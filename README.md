Obesity is one of the most pressing global health challenges, contributing to chronic diseases, reduced life expectancy, and growing healthcare costs. Many prevention strategies fail to identify individuals at risk early enough because they rely on population-level metrics instead of personalized insights.

This project applies machine learning classification techniques to predict a person’s obesity level based on lifestyle habits, eating behavior, and physical activity patterns. Using the publicly available dataset from PubMed (PMID: 31467953)
, the model learns to identify key behavioral factors that correlate with obesity risk.

The goal is to demonstrate how data-driven health analytics can support early risk detection, enable personalized wellness recommendations, and assist health organizations or fitness platforms in designing more effective intervention programs.

Through this project, I aim to showcase the potential of machine learning for social impact, combining data science and public health to promote better lifestyle outcomes.

Obesity is a growing public health and economic challenge, contributing to higher medical costs, reduced workforce productivity, and increased risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Traditional prevention programs often rely on broad population metrics rather than individualized risk assessment.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts a person’s obesity level based on lifestyle and dietary habits. Using a publicly available dataset from PubMed (PMID: 31467953), the model identifies behavioral patterns most strongly associated with obesity.

The insights generated can help health organizations, insurance providers, and wellness platforms design personalized interventions, promote early prevention, and allocate resources more effectively. Ultimately, the goal is to support data-driven health strategies that reduce obesity prevalence and improve quality of life.

“The objective is to build and evaluate classification models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks) to accurately predict obesity levels and identify the most influential lifestyle factors.”
