# Business Case
Obesity is a growing public health and economic challenge that contributes to higher medical costs, reduces workforce productivity, and increases risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts a person’s obesity level based on lifestyle and dietary habits. Using a publicly available dataset from [PubMed (PMID: 31467953)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31467953/). The insights generated can help health organizations, insurance providers, and wellness platforms design personalized interventions, promote early prevention, and allocate resources more effectively. Ultimately, the goal is to support data-driven health strategies that reduce obesity prevalence and improve quality of life. The objective of this project is to build and evaluate classification models for accurate prediction of obesity levels and identify the most influential lifestyle factors.
